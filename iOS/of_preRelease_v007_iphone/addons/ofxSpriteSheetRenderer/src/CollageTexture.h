/*
 Collage Texture provides simple methods for allocating and filling a texture
 with the contents of arbitrary files. I wrote it so that seperate images
 could be combined into a single sprite sheet on the fly, but it could be
 used for any purpose. It handles alpha blending of pasted images as well.
